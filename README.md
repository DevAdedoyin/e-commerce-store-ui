# e-commerce_store_ui aka Fashion store app is a minute simulation of a regular e-commerce fashion app.

# Get-x is being used as the state management solution in this app

# The only use of a state management solution was for the pageview indicator in the item detail page/screen

# The idea of the ui was gotten from https://dribbble.com/shots/14473051-eCommerce-Store-App-Design

# The exact images used from the dribble link above was not available. Therefore, I got images used in this app from https://www.asos.com/search/?page=1&q=coat
